At school we were given an hour-long break for lunch each day. Because my mother didn’t work and 
our apartment was so close by, I usually marched home with four or five other girls in tow, all of us 
talking nonstop, ready to sprawl on the kitchen floor to play jacks and watch All My Children while my 
mom handed out sandwiches. This, for me, began a habit that has sustained me for life, keeping a 
close and high-spirited council of girlfriends safe harbor of female wisdom. In my lunch group, we 
dissected whatever had gone on that morning at school, any beefs we had with teachers, any 
assignments that struck us as useless. Our opinions were largely formed by committee. We idolized 
the Jackson 5 and weren’t sure how we felt about the Osmonds. Watergate had happened, but none 
of us understood it. It seemed like a lot of old guys talking into microphones in Washington, D.C., 
which to us was just a faraway city filled with a lot of white buildings and white men. My mom, 
meanwhile, was plenty happy to serve us. It gave her an easy window into our world. As my friends 
and I ate and gossiped, she often stood by quietly, engaged in some household chore, not hiding the 
fact that she was taking in every word. In my family, with four of us packed into less than nine hundred 
square feet of living space, we’d never had any privacy anyway. It mattered only sometimes. Craig, 
who was suddenly interested in girls, had started taking his phone calls behind closed doors in the 
bathroom, the phone’s curlicue cord stretched taut across the hallway from its wall-mounted base in 
the kitchen.As Chicago schools went, Bryn Mawr fell somewhere between a bad school and a good 
school. Racial and economic sorting in the South Shore neighborhood continued through the 1970s, 
meaning that the student population only grew blacker and poorer with each year. There was, for a 
time, a citywide integration movement to bus kids to new schools, but Bryn Mawr parents had 
successfully fought it off, arguing that the money was better spent improving the school itself. As a kid, 
I had no perspective on whether the facilities were run-down or whether it mattered that there were 
hardly any white kids left. The school ran from kindergarten all the way through eighth grade, which 
meant that by the time I had reached the upper grades, I knew every light switch, every chalkboard 
and cracked patch of hallway. I knew nearly every teacher and most of the kids. For me, Bryn Mawr 
was practically an extension of home. As I was entering seventh grade, the Chicago Defender, a 
weekly newspaper that was popular with African American readers, ran a vitriolic opinion piece that 
claimed Bryn Mawr had gone, in the span of a few years, from being one of the city’s best public 
schools to a run- down slum governed by a ghetto mentality. Our school principal, Dr. Lavizzo, 
immediately hit back with a letter to the editor, defending his community of parents and students and 
deeming the newspaper piece an outrageous lie, which seems designed to incite only feelings of 
failure and flight.Dr. Lavizzo was a round, cheery man who had an Afro that puffed out on either side 
of his bald spot and who spent most of his time in an office near the building’s front door. It’s clear from 
his letter that he understood precisely what he was up against. Failure is a feeling long before it 
becomes an actual result. It’s vulnerability that breeds with self- doubt and then is escalated, often 
deliberately, by fear. Those feelings of failure he mentioned were everywhere already in my 
neighborhood, in the form of parents who couldn’t get ahead financially, of kids who were starting to 
suspect that their lives would be no different, of families who watched their better-off neighbors leave 
for the suburbs or transfer their children to Catholic schools. There were predatory real estate agents 
roaming South Shore all the while, whispering to homeowners that they should sell before it was too 
late, that they’d help them get out while you still can. The inference being that failure was coming, that 
it was inevitable, that it had already half arrived. You could get caught up in the ruin or you could 
escape it. They used the word everyone was most afraid of ghetto dropping it like a lit match. My 
mother bought into none of this. She’d lived in South Shore for ten years already and would end up 
staying another forty. She didn’t buy into fear mongering and at the same time seemed equally 
 
inoculated against any sort of pie-in-the-sky idealism. She was a straight-down-the-line realist, 
controlling what she could. At Bryn Mawr, she became one of the most active members of the PTA, 
helping raise funds for new classroom equipment, throwing appreciation dinners for the teachers, and 
lobbying for the creation of a special multigrade classroom that catered to higher-performing students. 
This last effort was the brainchild of Dr. Lavizzo, who’d gone to night school to get his PhD in 
education and had studied a new trend in grouping students by ability rather than by again essence, 
putting the brighter kids together so they could learn at a faster pace.
