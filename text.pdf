(When I was three and Bailey four, we had arrived in the musty little town, wearing tags on our) '
(wristswhich instructed-'To Whom It May Concern'-that we were Marguerite and Bailey Johnson Jr.,) '
(from Long Beach, California, en route to Stamps, Arkansas, c\057o Mrs. Annie Henderson.) '
(  Our parents had decided to put an end to their calamitous marriage, and Father shipped us home to) '
(his mother. A porter had been charged with our welfare-he got off the train the next day in Arizona-and) '
(our tickets were pinned to my brother's inside coat pocket.) '
(  I don't remember much of the trip, but after we reached the segregated southern part of the journey,) '
(things must have looked up. Negro passengers, who always traveled with loaded lunch boxes, felt) '
(sorry for 'the poor little motherless darlings' and plied us with cold fried chicken and potato salad.) '
(  Years later I discovered that the United States had been crossed thousands of times by frightened) '
(Black children traveling alone to their newly affluent parents in Northern cities, or back to) '
(grandmothers in Southern towns when the urban North reneged on its economic promises.) '
(  The town reacted to us as its inhabitants had reacted to all things new before our coming. It regarded) '
(us a while without curiosity but with caution, and after we were seen to be harmless \050and children\051 it) '
(closed in around us, as a real mother embraces a stranger's child. Warmly, but not too familiarly.) '
(  We lived with our grandmother and uncle in the rear of the Store \050it was always spoken of with a) '
(capital s\051, which she had owned some twenty-five years.) '
(  Early in the century, Momma \050we soon stopped calling her Grandmother\051 sold lunches to the sawmen) '
(in the lumberyard \050east Stamps\051 and the seedmen at the cotton gin \050west Stamps\051. Her crisp meat) '
(pies and cool lemonade, when joined to her miraculous ability to be in two places at the same time,) '
(assured her business success. From being a mobile lunch counter, she set up a stand between the) '
(two points of fiscal interest and supplied the workers' needs for a few years. Then she had the Store) '
(built in the heart of the Negro area. Over the years it became the lay center of activities in town. On) '
(Saturdays, barbers sat their customers in the shade on the porch of the Store, and troubadours on) '
(their ceaseless crawlings through the South leaned across its benches and sang their sad songs of) '
(The Brazos while they played juice harps and cigarbox guitars.) '
